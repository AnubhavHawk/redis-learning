1. Open redis.conf file and go to section: (31 page downs)
  ############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################
  
2. Change appendonly no to yes
  appendonly yes
  
  appenddirname "aof_files"               => this will create directory "aof_files" on top of config: dir /Ankit/redis_installation/
  
  fsync is already set to everysec:
  appendfsync everysec
  
  
3. Run set commands and check the file getting created in:
    /Ankit/redis_installation/aof_files
      
  
4. Check if your AOF file is valid and OK
     redis-check-aof  appendonly.aof.1.incr.aof
     
5. If its not OK, fix it using:
     redis-check-aof --fix appendonly.aof.1.incr.aof
     
     Note: simple way to fix it is since it append only, truncate the file till its format is OK


6. Compacting AOF file:
  from redis-cli run:
    bgrewriteaof
    
  Observe the logs and how aof file name got incremented from 1 to 2

* Suppose we have a website selling many products (FLipkart, Amazon) and we want to create 
  a stream of sales data tagged by product type (electronics, furniture, clothes, etc)
  
1. We publish messages to the channels like this:
  publish sales:electronics hp-laptop
  publish sales:electronics iphone
  publish sales:furniture bed
  publish sales:furniture bed
  publish sales:furniture bed
  publish sales:electronics iphone
  publish sales:clothes shirt
  
2. Using psubscribe subscribe to all channels 
  psubscribe sales:*
  
3. Publish message to any existing channel
  publish sales:electronics speakers
  
4. Verify if subscription got the message

5. Send message to a new subscription which did not exist
  publish sales:food oil
  
6. Verify that new channel was automatically subscribed and we received the msg

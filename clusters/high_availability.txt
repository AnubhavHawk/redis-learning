1. Connect to a master node:
  redis-cli -c -h XXXX -p 7000
  
2. Check its role:
  info replication
      # Replication
      role:master
      connected_slaves:1
      slave0:ip=XXXX,port=7005,state=online,offset=4844,lag=0
      master_failover_state:no-failover
      master_replid:4f991bb4cf4ba0978ecf9048fe080431c57a4730
      master_replid2:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
      master_repl_offset:4844
      second_repl_offset:-1
      repl_backlog_active:1
      repl_backlog_size:1048576
      repl_backlog_first_byte_offset:1
      repl_backlog_histlen:4844
      
 3. In this case redis running on port 7005 is its slave
 
 4. Bring this server down using shutdown command:
   SHUTDOWN
   
 5. Check that only 5 nodes are running now (instead of 6)
  ps ax | grep redis
  
 6. Connect to redis running on port 7005 which was slave
  redis-cli -c -h XXXX -p 7005
  
7. Check its role and validate that it became master
  info replication
  
8. Bring up the redis instance that was shutdown earlier
  redis-server 7000/7000.conf
  
9. It joins the cluster  back but as a slave
